# Predictive Maintenance of NASA CAMPS

## Overview

This project aims to predict the failure of aerospace systems using machine learning techniques, focusing on NASA's CAMPS (Condition-based Aircraft Maintenance) dataset. By analyzing historical data on component failures, the model helps predict potential maintenance issues, reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.

The task is framed as a **classification problem**, where the goal is to predict whether a component will fail or not based on various features collected from the system.

## Project Description

The Predictive Maintenance of NASA CAMPS project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the failure of different components based on a variety of sensor inputs. It allows for early detection of potential failures, minimizing downtime, and reducing maintenance costs in the aerospace industry.

### Key Features:
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, feature scaling, and transformation.
- **Modeling:** Classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

### Goals:
- Predict whether a component will fail in the next time period.
- Reduce unnecessary maintenance and optimize operational costs.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from NASAâ€™s CAMPS database. It contains sensor readings and operational data of aircraft components. Each entry includes several features (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration) and a target variable indicating whether the component failed or not.

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Features:** Various sensor readings and operational parameters.
- **Target:** Binary label (0 = No Failure, 1 = Failure).

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Encoding categorical variables if necessary.
- Scaling continuous features to improve model performance.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models are applied to the problem, and their performance is evaluated using cross-validation. Some of the models used in this project include:

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
4. **XGBoost Classifier**

Each model is evaluated using common classification metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
